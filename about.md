---

I am a passionate security researcher with a keen interest in red teaming, ransomware analysis, and Linux kernel vulnerabilities. My experience includes:

Red Teaming:
Actively hunting for malicious samples, implementing AV evasion techniques, working with C2 frameworks, analyzing ransomware campaigns, and developing custom ransomware tools.

Linux Kernel Research:
Analyzing and mitigating kernel vulnerabilities, exploring rootkit techniques, writing custom LPE exploits, and researching eBPF-based threats.

Ransomware Analysis:
Conducting static and dynamic analysis of Linux ransomware, analyzing encryption mechanisms, and reverse engineering using IDA Pro, Ghidra, and Radare2.

I am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest security trends and techniques, and contributing to the security community through my research and findings.
